            <p>
                Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Strength,</b> measuring physical power
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Dexterity,</b> measuring agility
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Constitution,</b> measuring endurance
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Intelligence,</b> measuring reasoning and memory
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Wisdom,</b> measuring perception and insight
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Charisma,</b> measuring force of personality
                </li>

                Is a character muscle-bound and insightful?
                Brilliant and charming?
                Nimble and hardy?
                Ability scores define these qualities - a creature's assets as well as their weaknesses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The three main rolls of the game - the ability check, the saving throw and the attack roll - rely on the six ability scores.
                The basic idea betwene these rolls is: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores and compare the total to a target number.
