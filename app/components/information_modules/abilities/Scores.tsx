            <p>
                Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. 
                An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.
            </p>
            <p>
                A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and monsters alike are often a cut above average in most abilites.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each ability has a modifier, derived from the socre and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30).
                The table below shows the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.
