            <h1> Barbarian </h1>
            <p>
                Barbarians are fierce warriors, harnessing their primal instincts and rage to become unstoppable forces on the battlefield. Whether driven by ancestral connections, a deep connection to nature, or sheer brute strength, barbarians revel in the chaos of combat.

                <b>Rage</b>
                <br />
                In battle, you fight with primal ferocity. On your turn, you can enter a rage as a bonus action.
                While raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing heavy armor:
                • You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
                • When you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a bonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian table.
                • You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.
                If you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate on them while raging. Your rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.
                Once you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a long rest before you can rage again.
